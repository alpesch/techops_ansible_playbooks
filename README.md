This repo contains Ansible playbooks. Currently, this focuses on deployment.

# How to use Ansible

* sudo pip install ansible
* git clone git@github.com:alpesch/techops_ansible_playbooks.git
* Modify hosts file according to your deployment (master node under master, 
  worker nodes under workers)
* Run the deployment_helper.sh script. This places the correct packages in /tmp/packages,
  where ansible expects them to be.
* run `ansible-playbook aws_turnup_playbook.yaml`
